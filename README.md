# DevLab: PDM MEMS Microphone MP34DT05

This is a breakout board for the PDM MEMS Microphone MP34DT05, a high-performance digital microphone with excellent signal-to-noise ratio and a very low power consumption. This module is based on the Adafruit PDM MEMS Microphone Breakout design, but it features the MP34DT05 microphone, which provides superior 
performance compared to other MEMS microphones.
